# The Ladder — Which Rung Answers Which Question

Two rungs. The rung is chosen in the Brief and recorded in `Tested on` when the experiment closes.

> **Escalation discipline.** The cheapest rung that can *actually* answer the question — and before
> any build: arithmetic. Balance, pacing, reward math, session-length math and budget headroom are
> settled **in the document**, in minutes, for free. Most hypotheses that get sent to a build could
> have died there. Ask once, out loud, before briefing a build.

## 1 · Desktop Explorer via Creator Hub — the default

**This is not an expensive rung.** Creator Hub launches the Explorer client by default: a scene
opens in about a minute, hot-reload turns the edit-look loop into seconds, and a greybox for one
mechanic is **15–30 minutes of building, not hours**. Do not inflate estimates — an owner told "an
hour or two of building" walks away; told "fifteen minutes and you're clicking bubbles", they stay.

Settles: existence, layout, rough timing, **feel, input response, the 10th repetition** — and
multiplayer, with real people in the scene. Unless the brief argues otherwise, a hypothesis about
**fun** is settled here. Mind what the verdict earns: an owner self-test writes `survived`
(kill-check held) or `failed` — `validated` takes measured evidence, arithmetic or an
agent-instrumented run.

> **Runtime facts are checked, not assumed.** Before claiming anything about what is running — which
> client the preview launched, whether an MCP server is up, whether a restart is needed after a
> config change — check the live thing itself. The preview port varies (Creator Hub has served 8000
> *and* 8001): find it by probing `/scene.json`, never by trusting a number from any doc, including

**Who launches — ask first.** The owner may prefer to launch the scene themselves from Creator Hub
(their everyday workflow, their client), or want you to run the preview server and push the
deeplink. One question, recommendation attached; never spawn servers or open clients unasked.

**Driving the Explorer.** Two legitimate setups, in order of preference:

- **sdk-skills installed in the scene** (`npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills` → `.claude/skills/`
  inside the scene repo): use its Explorer-MCP skill directly — it is callable, and it gives
  screenshots, camera moves and scene state without leaving the session.
- **No sdk-skills:** the unity-explorer repo's own `mcp-scene-iteration` skill is
  `disable-model-invocation: true` — **you cannot invoke it; only the owner can**, as a slash
  command. Ask the owner to run it, or read its reference material as knowledge and watch the owner
  play. Do not write, imply, or plan around "the skill calls the other skill". (If `mcp__explorer__*`
  tools are already present in the session, they are usable directly — that is a different thing
  from invoking a skill.)

## Who tests — ask it in the Brief

Record in the Brief **who runs the sessions**, as a question to the owner with a recommendation:

- **The skill itself, via MCP** — mechanical validation only: the scene runs, the metric records,
  the physics does what the brief says. **Never a fun verdict** — fun is felt by a human.
- **The creator, by hand** — the only source of a *feel* verdict, and at v0 usually the only tester
  available. External testers and their moderation protocol are v1+ material — staged in the
  program's `Games/prod-staging/` folder.
- **Both** (*recommended default*): the skill smoke-tests through MCP first, so the creator's first
  session is spent feeling the mechanic — not discovering that it doesn't compile.

## 2 · Mobile — last, and the point of all of it

The **primary design target** — design for here first, test here last. No longer an expensive rung:
**the check costs minutes, not sessions.**

**The QR pass** (verified): Creator Hub → the dropdown next to **Preview** → **Show QR Code for
Mobile** → point the phone camera at it. CLI fallback: `npm run start -- --mobile` (prints the QR
in the terminal; the desktop explorer does not launch with this flag). Phone and machine must share
one Wi-Fi — a personal hotspot beats corporate isolation. Hot-reload reaches the phone, so you
iterate without re-scanning.

A **mobile-sensitive** hypothesis — for a hobbyist core loop, assume most input and performance
claims are — still closes with a terminal suffix at the verdict (`_validated` / `_survived` /
`_failed`); the index renders *… — mobile pending* from `Mobile-sensitive: yes` + `Tested on:
desktop` while that is true. The mobile check is **the last check of the core-loop stage**: at
stage close, offer the QR pass (~5 min) and record the answer — offer, never force.

Cheap proxies still come before the pass: one screenshot on one phone answers "is this readable at
arm's length"; thumb-reach and tap-target questions are answerable on a still image; asset-weight
arithmetic precedes any frame-rate measurement.

## Choosing the rung

| The hypothesis is about | Where it settles |
|---|---|
| balance, pacing, reward math, budget headroom | arithmetic in the doc — no build |
| existence, layout, feel, timing, the 10th repetition | 1 · desktop Explorer |
| multiplayer, other players' presence, social moments | 1 · desktop Explorer, with real people |
| touch input, one-handed reach, small-screen legibility | 2 · mobile (screenshot proxy first) |
| frame rate under load | arithmetic first, then 1, then 2 |

## Numbers

> **Never quote numeric scene budgets from memory.** Triangle, entity, texture and file-size limits are
> deliberately absent from this file. Look them up in the current SDK7 documentation before a number
> goes into a brief or a verdict, and cite where it came from. A wrong budget carried into a proposal
> is worse than a `TBD:` with a plan to check it.

The program's own performance bar (frame-rate targets, player counts) lives in the program doc and in
`/pre-prod-gdd`'s `references/mobile-first.md` — read it there rather than restating it here.
